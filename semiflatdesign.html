		<p class="class">In the past few years flat design ruled the web design market but now, influenced by Material Design, it is becoming more dimensional. This transition begins with some light shadows, making it a semi flat design. The evolution of flat design from a minimalist style suits the new developing technologies. Flat design is still in, but it has undergone some improvements.

		The smooth shading adds a depth and complexity without destroying the flat design feeling. This is a new feature added to the flat trend and will continue to evolve in 2017. </p>
