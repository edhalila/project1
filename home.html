			        <p class="class">Design trends are influenced by media, technology, the fashion industry and, lately usability. A trend emerges slowly, gradually, making its way into all design branches, and then disappears in exactly the same way. Basically a design trend's life is no longer than one or two years. Design in 2017 will continue the trends that materialized in 2016 while adding some new influences, but the feeling is well known and familiar and you may have seen it in the past  couple of years. The main influencer remains Google's Material Design, that suffers a few changes.</p>

        <p> Web design lives at the intersection of form and function. It makes sense, therefore, that web design trends are heavily influenced by technology, be it the types of devices we use, their processing power, the sophistication of our browsers or the programing libraries available to us. But they’re also impacted by design principals and philosophies.</p>
